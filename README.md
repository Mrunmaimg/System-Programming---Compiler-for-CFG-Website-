# System-Programming---Compiler-for-CFG-Website-



This project implements a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) compiler using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to define CFG rules, input a string to be parsed, and visualize the parse tree generated by the recursive descent parser.

## Features

- **Grammar Rule Input**: Users can define CFG rules in a simple format, with multiple RHS options separated by `|`.
- **String Parsing**: Users can input a string to parse based on the defined grammar.
- **Parse Tree Visualization**: The tool generates and displays the parse tree in a hierarchical format.
- **Support for Epsilon (ε) Productions**: Handles epsilon productions and non-terminal symbols effectively.
- **Compiled Grammar Display**: Shows the compiled CFG rules for clarity.

## Usage

1. Enter the CFG rules in the text area provided, using the format `S -> a A | ε`, where `S` is the non-terminal and `a`, `A`, or `ε` are the productions.
2. Input the string to be parsed in the text field.
3. Click the **Compile and Parse** button to generate the parse tree.
4. The compiled grammar and the generated parse tree will be displayed below the input fields.



### How to Use

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mrunmaimg/System-Programming---Compiler-for-CFG-Website-.git
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Enter your grammar rules and the string to parse, then click "Compile and Parse" to see the results.



### Example

**Grammar:**
```
S -> a A | ε
A -> b
```

**String to Parse:**
```
ab
```

This example would generate a parse tree with the following structure:
```
S
└── a
    └── A
        └── b
```

## How it Works

The CFG Compiler processes the grammar rules and performs parsing using a recursive descent approach. The grammar is represented as an object, and the parsing function recursively checks the input string against the grammar's rules. If the string can be parsed successfully, a parse tree is generated and displayed.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more advanced grammar features.
- Improve the visualization of the parse tree using graphical libraries.
- Include error handling and detailed feedback for invalid inputs.
